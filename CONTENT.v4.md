## Transforming Weather Forecasting for Climate Resilience

### From Uncertainty to Informed Decisions

In Ghana's Pra River Basin, unpredictable weather patterns have been devastating smallholder farmers—causing up to 30% crop losses, threatening food security for over 4,000 people, and pushing rural communities deeper into poverty. Only 30% of farmers access meteorological forecasts, and traditional forecasting methods are becoming less reliable as climate patterns shift.

**SIWA changes this reality by uniting two powerful knowledge systems:** the time-tested wisdom of indigenous ecological indicators and the precision of modern AI technology. The result? Farmers gain reliable, localized forecasts that turn uncertainty into opportunity—enabling smarter decisions that protect livelihoods and increase yields.

#### How SIWA Makes the Difference

**Co-Created with Farmers**  
Developed directly with farming communities across three regions, SIWA isn't a top-down solution. Farmers shaped every feature, validated every indicator, and continue guiding its evolution.

**Scientifically Validated Indigenous Indicators**  
We've documented and verified over 20 indigenous ecological indicators including cloud formations, moon phases, plant behaviors (Ceiba, Emire, Ope trees), animal patterns (cattle birds, frogs, termites), and atmospheric conditions. Research confirms these achieve 27-42% accuracy for 12-hour forecasts.

**AI-Powered Integration**  
Machine learning models trained on farmer-collected data merge indigenous observations with official Ghana Meteorological Agency forecasts, creating more accurate, localized predictions than either system alone.

**Designed for Accessibility**  
Icon-based interface that works with minimal literacy, functions in low-connectivity areas, available in local languages, and designed with input from women farmers who produce 70% of Ghana's food crops.

**Community-Driven Data**  
Installed rain gauges enable farmers to record actual rainfall, creating a feedback loop that continuously improves forecast accuracy while building local weather intelligence.

## How SIWA Works

### Simple Steps, Powerful Results

**1. Observe & Record**  
Farmers use the mobile app to log indigenous indicators they notice—cloud patterns, frog calls, tree flowering, wind changes. The icon-based interface makes recording intuitive and quick.

**2. Predict & Share**  
Based on their observations and traditional knowledge, farmers submit weather predictions through simple icons. No typing, no complexity.

**3. Measure & Track**  
Using calibrated rain gauges at their homes, farmers record actual rainfall twice daily, building a local weather database.

**4. Learn & Decide**  
SIWA's AI combines farmer observations with scientific forecasts to deliver increasingly accurate predictions:
- Rainfall onset and cessation timing
- Rainfall intensity forecasts
- Planting and irrigation alerts
- Crop disease warnings
- Water management recommendations

**The Outcome:** Where farmers once faced 30% crop losses from unreliable information, SIWA provides the localized, timely forecasts needed for critical decisions about planting, irrigation, fertilizer application, and harvesting—reducing waste, protecting investments, and increasing food security.
