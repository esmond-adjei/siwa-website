## Problem Section

**Headline:** Climate Uncertainty is Threatening Food Security

**Body:**

In Ghana's Pra River Basin, irregular rainfall patterns are devastating smallholder farmers who depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture. The challenge is critical:

- **70% of food crops** are produced by women farmers, yet they receive less than 10% of agricultural credit
- Farmers experience **up to 30% crop losses** due to unreliable weather information and false seasonal starts
- Only **30% of farmers** have access to meteorological information, primarily through distant radio broadcasts
- Climate projections predict a **1.77% reduction in rainfall** and **1.51°C temperature increase** by 2049
- Over **4,000 people** in farming communities face increasing food insecurity

Traditional indigenous forecasting methods—passed down through generations—are becoming less reliable as climate patterns shift unpredictably. Meanwhile, scientific forecasts from distant meteorological stations often lack the localized, timely information farmers need to make critical decisions about planting, irrigation, and harvesting.

**The result?** Crop failures, costly replanting, post-harvest losses, and deepening poverty in rural communities.

## Solution Section

**Headline:** Where Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Technology

**Subheadline:** SIWA bridges the gap between indigenous knowledge and scientific forecasting

**What Makes SIWA Unique:**

**1. Co-Produced with Farmers**
Unlike top-down solutions, SIWA was developed through direct collaboration with farming communities across three regions. Farmers aren't just users—they're co-creators who validated every indigenous ecological indicator integrated into the system.

**2. Validated Indigenous Knowledge**
We've systematically documented and verified 20+ indigenous ecological indicators including:
- Cloud patterns and formations
- Moon phases and celestial observations
- Plant behaviors (Ceiba, Emire, Ope trees)
- Animal indicators (cattle birds, frogs, termites, ants)
- Atmospheric conditions (wind, heat, dew, fog)

Research shows these indicators achieve **27-42% accuracy** for 12-hour forecasts and **31-38% accuracy** for 24-hour predictions.

**3. AI-Enhanced Forecasting**
Machine learning models trained on farmer-collected data integrate indigenous indicators with scientific forecasts from the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet), creating more reliable, localized predictions.

**4. Built for Accessibility**
- Icon-driven interface requiring minimal literacy
- Works in low-connectivity environments
- Available in local languages
- Designed with input from women farmers and youth

**5. Real-Time Data Collection**
Community-installed rain gauges enable farmers to record actual rainfall, creating a continuous feedback loop that improves forecast accuracy over time.

## How It Works Section

**Headline:** Four Steps to Climate-Resilient Farming

**Step 1: Observe**
Farmers use the SIWA mobile app to record indigenous ecological indicators they observe—from cloud patterns to frog behavior to tree flowering.

**Step 2: Predict**
Based on observed indicators, farmers submit their weather predictions through the intuitive icon-based interface. No typing required.

**Step 3: Measure**
Using calibrated rain gauges installed at their homes, farmers record actual rainfall readings morning and evening.

**Step 4: Learn**
The AI model continuously learns from this data, combining indigenous observations with scientific forecasts from GMet to deliver increasingly accurate, localized weather predictions including:
- Rainfall onset and cessation
- Heavy, medium, or small rainfall forecasts
- Planting and irrigation alerts
- Crop disease warnings
- Water management guidance

**The Result:** Farmers receive timely, reliable forecasts that align with both traditional wisdom and modern meteorology—enabling better decisions about planting dates, irrigation schedules, fertilizer application, and harvesting.
