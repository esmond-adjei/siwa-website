### **The Problem**

**Irregular Rainfall Disrupts Livelihoods**
[cite_start]In the Pra River Basin, irregular rainfall patterns disrupt rainfed agriculture, which is the primary source of irrigation for numerous small-scale farmers[cite: 440, 1480]. [cite_start]Farmers are often unable to access scientific weather forecast information due to ineffective communication channels[cite: 307].

**The Cost of Uncertainty**
* [cite_start]**5–10% National Loss:** Currently, 5–10% of national losses in agricultural production are comparable to climatic variability[cite: 357].
* [cite_start]**Reliance on Struggling Methods:** Due to rapidly changing weather conditions, farmers rely entirely on traditional forecasting methods, which are no longer sufficient for informed decision-making[cite: 308].
* [cite_start]**Low Accuracy:** The current proficiency of farmers in predicting daily weather using only traditional methods ranges between 27% and 42%[cite: 278].

**Why It Matters**
[cite_start]Smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable to these changes, often planting too soon after a "false" start to the growing season, resulting in crop failure and food insecurity[cite: 290, 309].

### **The Solution**

**Bridging Tradition and Science**
[cite_start]SIWA is a unique solution that integrates indigenous ecological forecasting knowledge with AI technology to improve farmers' weather predictions and agricultural decision-making[cite: 1493, 1497].

**How It Is Unique**
* [cite_start]**Co-Production:** The app is built on a co-production model involving researchers, agricultural extension officers, and farming communities to ensure relevance and trust[cite: 1874, 2006].
* [cite_start]**Culturally Sensitive:** It validates and digitizes indigenous knowledge—such as the observation of clouds, moon phases, and animal behavior—preserving it for future generations[cite: 1858, 807].
* [cite_start]**Data-Driven:** By combining these traditional insights with machine learning algorithms, SIWA creates a more robust forecasting tool optimized for African agricultural contexts[cite: 1881].

### **How It Works**

**1. Data Collection via Android App**
[cite_start]Farmers use the custom-built **Sapelli mobile app** to record daily weather predictions and indigenous ecological indicators (such as heat, wind, clouds, and stars)[cite: 753, 1518]. [cite_start]They also input data from farm-level rain gauges to track actual precipitation[cite: 1518, 779].

**2. AI Model Integration**
[cite_start]We build a machine learning model using this collected data[cite: 1522]. [cite_start]The system validates the accuracy of indigenous forecasts against scientific data, creating a verified, AI-enhanced forecasting model[cite: 1881].

**3. Delivery of Improved Forecasts**
[cite_start]The integrated model is deployed back to the mobile app, providing farmers with improved, indicator-based forecasts to guide planting and harvesting decisions[cite: 1524, 1868].

### **Our Impact**

**Tangible Benefits for Farmers**
* [cite_start]**30% Reduction in Loss:** Participating farmers are expected to reduce crop losses by up to 30% relative to baseline data[cite: 1855].
* [cite_start]**Food Security:** The project aims to improve food security for over 4,000 people and provide greater income stability for more than 1,000 families[cite: 1856, 1857].

**Empowering Women and Youth**
* [cite_start]**Inclusive Design:** We target at least 50% recruitment of women and 30% youth in data collection and training to address gender inequities in land ownership and credit access[cite: 1918].
* [cite_start]**Capacity Building:** Over 500 farmers will receive training workshops to interpret and use both indigenous and scientific climate data[cite: 1851, 1876].
