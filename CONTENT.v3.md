## 🌧️ The Problem

### Climate uncertainty is breaking traditional farming systems

Across Ghana — especially in the Pra River Basin — **rainfall patterns are becoming unpredictable**, leading to crop failure, income loss, and food insecurity.

**Key challenges:**

* Only **~30% of farmers** have access to scientific weather information, mostly via radio — often **too general or unreliable** for farm-level decisions 
* Farmers regularly experience **false season starts**, causing replanting and yield loss
* Climate models predict:

  * **1.5°C temperature increase**
  * **Reduced and more erratic rainfall**
  * Increased drought and flood risks 

Despite this, farmers **still rely heavily on indigenous forecasting knowledge** — cloud behavior, plant responses, wind, heat, and animal signals — because **modern forecasts are not localized or trusted**.

Yet this indigenous knowledge is:

* Largely undocumented
* Not integrated into formal climate services
* At risk of being lost

## 🌱 The Solution: SIWA

### A new climate intelligence system — co-created with farmers

**SIWA (Smart Indigenous Weather App)** is a **mobile-first climate service** that combines:

* **Indigenous ecological indicators**
* **Scientific meteorological data**
* **Machine learning models**
* **Citizen-generated rainfall data**

Unlike conventional weather apps, SIWA is:

* **Hyper-local** — grounded in farmer observations
* **Culturally trusted** — built on indigenous knowledge
* **Scientifically validated** — tested through academic research
* **Continuously improving** — learns as more data is collected

SIWA transforms indigenous knowledge from *informal wisdom* into **validated, AI-enhanced climate intelligence**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### From farmer observations to AI-powered forecasts

1. **Farmers collect data via the Android app**

   * Daily weather predictions
   * Indigenous indicators (clouds, heat, moon, wind, trees)
   * Rain gauge readings

2. **Data is synchronized and validated**

   * Cross-checked with scientific datasets
   * Cleaned and structured for modeling

3. **AI models are trained**

   * Machine learning learns relationships between indicators and actual weather outcomes
   * Models are optimized for Ghanaian agro-climatic conditions

4. **Forecasts are delivered back to farmers**

   * Localized planting alerts
   * Early warnings
   * Seasonal guidance
   * Climate-smart decision support

5. **The system improves continuously**

   * Every new data point strengthens forecast accuracy

## 🌾 Impact

### Measurable benefits for farmers and communities

**Early results and projections show:**

* **Up to 30% reduction in crop losses** among participating farmers 
* **Improved decision-making** on planting, irrigation, and harvesting
* **Over 1,000 farming households** expected to benefit directly
* **More than 4,000 people** supported through improved food security
* Indigenous forecasting knowledge **digitized, preserved, and validated**

Beyond farmers, SIWA:

* Strengthens **climate adaptation capacity**
* Supports **SDGs 1 (No Poverty), 2 (Zero Hunger), and 13 (Climate Action)**
* Creates a **replicable model** for other climate-vulnerable regions in Africa

## 🤝 Credibility & Partners

### Built by trusted institutions, validated by research

SIWA is developed through a strong ecosystem of academic, institutional, and community partners:

* **Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)**
  Faculty of Electrical & Computer Engineering
* **Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet)**
* **Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)**
* Peer-reviewed **MPhil research validating indigenous forecast accuracy** in the Pra River Basin
* Supported under **British Council Innovation for African Universities (IAU)** initiatives

The forecasting framework has been **scientifically verified**, showing that **1 in 3 indigenous daily forecasts are accurate**, and even higher accuracy for predicting *no-rain events* — critical for farming decisions .
